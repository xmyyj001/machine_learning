Coursera Machine Learning
In this course project, I adopted elastic net regression, LDA, QDA and Random forests model to train the personal activity data, furthermore, I use caret::resample() function to evaluate performance of multiple machine learning algorithms. The founding is  Random forests are difficult to interpret but very accurate. With the Random forests algorithm, the forecasting data got the prediction:`r rf_model$levels` by `r re`.
